# calendar_toy

## V 7.0

~~working on integration of ics generator with older versions of the toy to create~~
~~strong base for the future.~~ 

JS works really well on mobile. Download ics can be opened in google calendar and outlook (iCal unconfirmed but VERY LIKELY)

~~Close to getting the google url to work.~~

Desktop Google Method functional.

## TODO:

- [X] Work on integrating form values to create ics
- [X] Make sure licensing is correct
- [X] Get quick action / streamline process on non-mobile system
- [X] HTML Google calendar system for desktop systems
